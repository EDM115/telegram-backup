+ `/backup {id}`. {id} can be @channelname or -100Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—
+ *(optional)* `/range Ã—Ã—:Ã—Ã—`. Ã—Ã— are the numbers of start:end of posts/messages backup
+ `/dump {id}` id of chat/channel where you back it up. Bot MUST be admin with full rights there
+ *(optional, True by default)* `/tag {True}/{False}` If you need the forward tag or either send as copy --> will replace by 1/0 for simpler comparison
+ `/go` HERE WE GOOOOOOOW ! Sends a message with progressbar, success/fail (fails are mostly due to deleted messages) and when it's done
  Can take less or more time depending to how many messages
